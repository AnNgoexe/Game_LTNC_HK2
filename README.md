## HOW TO PLAY GAME
Your task is to reach the highest score by receiving awards while the game character is still alive. <br/>
1. When game menu appears, click "Play" button to start or "Instruction" button to read instruction. If you do not want to play, click "Exit" button to exit.
2. While playing, press button "Space" to avoid danger (bat,stone and cactus) and receive awards (diamond,coin and heart). Besides, click "Pause" button to stop playing 
for a while and click "Resume" button to continue.
3. There are 3 numbers on the screen: score, life and road <br/>
_ At first, game character has 3 lives. Every time it collides with a danger, its life will decrease by 1. If the number of lives is smaller than 1, you lose. <br/>
_ Score will increase depending on the award. If a coin, score will increase by 10. If a diamond, score will increase by 20. If a heart and the number of lives is smaller
or equal to 3, life will increase by 1. <br/>
_ Road number increases continuously and shows the number of metres that game character has run. <br/>
